Training a car to drive itself through a track

# Basics
The base classes needed:
- RaceTrack
- Car
- Laser

The general idea is to have a car with various lidar sensors positioned around
it, and to use that input data to adjust acceleration and steering commands to
get the car around the track.

# Demo

A simple controller is used to test out features, and to see how difficult
it is to manually code how to drive
